When we talk about model we actually mean fitting a line/function to our training data by minimizing the error distance of that line and the datapoints. The RMSE is the distance, on average, of a data point from the fitted line, measured along a vertical line. That is probably the most easily interpreted statistic, since it has the same units as the quantity plotted on the vertical axis. In our case that is the value in €. Thus, the smaller the RMSE, the better your model. "
